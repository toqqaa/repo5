# Implement the breadth-first search (BFS) path planning algorithm

**Grid Traversal:**
Create a grid (2D array) representing a maze or terrain where some cells are obstacles and others are open spaces. Start with a simple 5x5 grid and mark start and end points. Implement BFS to find the shortest path between these points, considering only horizontal and vertical movements (no diagonal movements).
