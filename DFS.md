# Implementing the depth-first search (DFS) path planning algorithm

**Grid Traversal:**
Similar to BFS, create a grid (2D array) representing a maze or terrain with obstacles and open spaces. Define start and end points. Implement DFS to find a path between these points. Start with a simple 5x5 grid.
